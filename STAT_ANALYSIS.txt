Notes after 1996:
Runs are down in AL, 11794 from real of 12208
Remedy: Improve SAC, lower DP, Reduce out errors, increase sac flies, improve odds of taking extra bases by 2 points

Sac Flies are half of real
Remedy: Replace DP ground balls with fly outs in FAC, improve OBR on 3rd ratings

Sac Bunts are down 67% of real
Remedy: Partially by choice, but will improve ratings to make more attactive

Double Plays are over 25% of real
Remedy: Make sac bunts more attractive, replace DP ground balls with fly balls

Errors are way down from real
