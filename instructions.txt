***Quick Play Instructions***
(Disclaimer: Since I rarely play in this mode, there may be some bugs. But this is a good mode to play in to get used to the game)

1. From the opening Choose Teams window, select Single Game mode.
2. Choose a home team and a visiting team, and the league rules (AL or NL) and click OK.
3. The view will immediately place you in the lineup screen for the home team. A good habit to get into is to select your pitcher first, so that you can easily add him to your lineup in NL contests. Select Pitching.
4. All of the available starting pitchers are shown in the list box. If there are more than 15 pitcher cards, you will need to scroll down (using the scroll bar on the right) to view them all. Select a starter from the list box, and click on Visitor bullpen.
5. Choose the starting pitcher for the Visiting team and select Hitting.
6. Select your lineup by selecting a player from the list box and clicking the --> button. If you make a mistake, click the reverse <-- button. To scrap your entire lineup and start over, select Clear.
7. You must fill out the 9 positions in your lineup. Each added player will show their default position in the combo box. Click on the combo box to choose a different position. For outfielders, you must choose a LF, CF and RF. The game will not start until all positions are filled.
8. Click Visitor Lineup and choose the lineup.
9. Now we're ready to play! Click Play Ball.
10. The home team is on the left and the visiting team is on the right, similar to the Statis Pro game board.
11. The player card that is at bat is highlighted in blue. In this case, the visiting batter on the right is facing the home pitcher on the left. To get a result, click on the blue Pitch button.
12. The result of the play will show on the center message board. If a player gets on base, the base they are on will highlight in red, and the runner's name, OBR and SP rating will show as well.
13. The Pitcher Reduction (PR) meter is shown next to the pitcher. Once it is empty the pitcher will no longer have an effect, so keep an eye on this.
14. The lineups are shown with yellow letters along the sides, which represent how they bat (Lefty,Righty, or Switch). This helps the pitching team plan pitching matchups.
15. To make a pitching change, click on the Pitching button on the bottom. In the NL, you will also need to make a Lineup change to enter your pitcher into the lineup, and possibly do a double switch. If you go in just to view pitchers and do not want to make a change, you will need to click X at the top right corner.
16. To make a lineup change, click on the Lineup button. To insert a new player, select a player from the list box, then select the player on the right that he is replacing, then click the Switch button. Again, the default position will show, but you don't have to choose the position now. You can wait until the end of the inning in case you want to double switch or you don't want that player to field. To erase a lineup change, click Reset. Once you are finished, click on Exit. Once you click Exit, the change cannot be reversed. If you forget to fill in the positions correctly at the end of the inning, the game will force you back to the lineup screen to fix it.
17. To make a defensive change, click on the Lineup button and then select Other team. You must have the correct 9 positions when finished.
18. For each batter, the pitching and hitting manager have the options shown in the Options window. Normal is the default with every play. You can Hit and Run if there is a man on first, or first and third. You can always attempt to steal a base. You can sacrifice if there is no one on third. You can bunt for a hit if no one is on. Intentional Walks will not count against the pitcher's PR reduction. The defense can choose whether to have the infield in. The Do Not Steal option needs more explaining...
19. I have added an auto steal feature to this game, where you can leave it up to the base stealer to steal or not. The intent of the feature was to end up with a more realistic number of team steals at the end of the season. For example, in 1982 there were 2 teams (Minnesota and Baltimore) where all the hitters were SP C, D or E. Under the Statis Pro rules, it didn't make any sense to send this type of runner in any situation, and at the end of the season you would end up with less than 10 team steals when in reality they had 50 to 60. So what I did is added the auto steal feature where a runner will, on occasion, attempt to steal a base if the score is within two runs. The better the SP rating, the more often the runner will attempt. All SP levels have the same success rate of about 68%. For example, SP E would never attempt, SP D would attempt 8 times over 162 games, SP C about 21 times, SP B would attempt 35 times, SP A would attempt 50 times, SP Y would attempt 100 times, SP Z would attempt about 140. SP Y and Z were my own inventions. It was easier to program then "steals after single on own card". If you are in a situation where you do not want your runner to risk getting thrown out, just click on Do Not Steal. Auto Steal is in effect for runners on 2nd who can potentially steal 3rd, but these are rare and only apply to SP B runners or better, and if there are less than 2 outs. The auto steal also keeps SB numbers reasonable. When I play my brother, I love to play Whitey-Ball and have my speedsters steal 2nd at all times. At the end of the season, the SB numbers would become greatly inflated. So if you want realistic SB numbers, never attempt to steal base and let auto-steal take over. But if you love the speed game like me, steal, steal, steal!
20. After playing a few games, you'll be ready for the Season mode...
21. To end the game at any time, click End Game.






***SEASON PLAY***
The game play in Season mode is the same as Single game mode, but Season mode is much more fun because of: Statistics, Pennant races, playoffs, World Series, starting Rotations and 25 man rosters. I would recommend following the instruction above before proceeding here. Don't bother selecting Half-Season mode as it probably doesn't work (I know, I need to remove it).

1. To start a season, select Season Play. 2007 should be the default season.
2. 25 man rosters are optional. If you do not wish to be limited by 25 man rosters, just don't click on the 25 man roster button. What I like to do is play a few games with the full roster, get an idea of my April 25 man roster, and throughout the season I bring players up and down, maintaining a 25 man roster, so that everyone generally plays as much as their cards dictate. If you take a batter off of the active roster, they must be out at least 15 games (similar to a DL). I did not place this limitation on pitchers, but I probably should.
3. Click OK.
4. First, select your starting pitchers. The only fatigue factor I placed on this game is if a pitcher exceeded 2 innings in the previous game, they cannot pitch in the current game. That is why you will not see yesterday's starter in the pick list.
5. Next, choose your lineup. The first thing you will notice is the player card backgrounds have various colors after you play the first game of the season. The colors denote the following: pink = inactive, white = player did not play last game, blue = player had a hit last game, yellow = player went hitless. These were requirements of my brother and I never took them out. The pick list should only have active players listed. Once finished, click Play Ball.
6. There are a few differences on the main display for this mode. Below the box score, there is a display showing the real time stats of the current batter. In addition, the current game stats and season E.R.A are shown above the pitcher cards. You can click on the Stats button at the bottom to load the season Stat tool.
7. At the conclusion of each game, a Game Over box will pop up. Just click okay, and the pitchers of record will show on the display. You will need to click on the End Game button to save the game and start a new one.
8. In the archive subfolder under your main install folder (for example C:\Program Files\SPB\archive), you will find box scores for every game you play.
9. In your main folder is a file called desclog.txt. It is a log of the play by play for all games. If the file becomes too large, you can delete it any time and a new one will start up.
10. Viewing/Editing the schedule. In the schedule subfolder is a file called 2007.scd. This is your schedule file. To view it, open it up by right clicking on it and selecting Open With..., and then choose NotePad (ALWAYS USE NOTEPAD). The schedule is listed in a series of homestands, with the home team on the left, the visiting team listed next, and then the number of games in the series, and then the league rules to be used. If you keep the same format of each row, you can come up with your own schedule, shorten it, etc. If you follow the default schedule, every team will play 162 games loaded with many divisional games. The only thing missing is the inter-league play. I found this to be too much of a challenge to program, and I don't really like inter-league play anyway. I apologize if you are a big inter-league fan.
11. Editing Player cards. Only do this if you are at least somewhat technical. The player cards are listed as .csv files in the teams subfolder. To edit, DO NOT DOUBLE CLICK ON THE FILE. This will bring up Excel, which will change your 2-9 PB rating to a date of Feb. 9th, causing you to have to reinstall the cards. Always right click on the files, and select Open With...Notepad. I know many of you have your own hardcore opinions on Statis Pro card creation, so you can easily update the players this way with your own cards. I will reveal my formulas in a couple of weeks.
